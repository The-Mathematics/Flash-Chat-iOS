# Flash-Chat

## Our Goal

The goal of this project is to dive into complex aspects of SWIFT programming such as:

* Navigation Controller - Stacks and Segues
When we use segues to connect multiple ViewControllers, the screens appear to lay untop of one another in an animated way
But if we want to totally replace the previous screen with a new screen, we use something called a “Navigation Stack”

* Third Party Libraries Using Cocoapods
In programming, Third Party libraries are collections of pre-written code, functions, or routines that developers can use to perform common tasks. 

* Creating A cloud-based Backend Database Using Firebase
Firebase is an all in one suite of tools that is backed by google that allows us to do a bunch of things like; Storing data in the cloud, see crashes that occur in our app, Authenticate users or store their passwords and information securely, incorporating Google analytics and loads of other things.

* Using A Constants File And Understanding The Static Keyword
Constant file helps reduce the possibility of making errors when using strings that tend to be reused multiple times in our code.
The static keyword is used to turn constants and functions into type properties that can be accessed without creating an instance.

* How To Use UITableView and Creating Custom UI with .xib files
UITableViews are essential to most iOS app, this Flaschat App shows how to populate UITableView using a custom reusable cell 



## What the App does

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. We will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 



## What you will learn

* How to integrate third party libraries in your app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.

* How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.

* How to query and sort the Firebase database.

* How to use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.

* How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.

* How to create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.

* How to embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.

* How to create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.

* Learn about the App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.

* How to create direct Segues for navigation.



## Prerequisites for project

* Xcode

* Knowledge on what Third Party Libraries are and using .xcworkspace

* Knowledge on how to use segues to navigate through views in an App

* Knowledge on Structs and Classes

* Please Create a Firebase Account and Read Documetation on Firebase Website on how to add firebase to your project
